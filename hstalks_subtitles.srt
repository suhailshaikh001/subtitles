00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,180
Hi, I am Jennifer Boss and welcome to
five Questions on Virtual Coaching.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm Mi Louise Heeder and I'm on
faculty at Vanderbilt University

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,500
and work with DTL on coaching.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:20,940
So, um, what are the key considerations
for coaches and coaches to keep in

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,820
mind for effective virtual coaching?

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,230
One of the things I think is that we
have to remember that you still have

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,330
to do coaching the way it was designed.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,630
And so that means that
relationships are important.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,490
That means that you have to have a plan.

10
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:38,940
That means that you have to have a way
to observe that you have a good way

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,470
to do reflection and feedback, but it
also means you have to be flexible,

12
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,780
especially in this virtual world.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,040
And so what does that mean to.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,820
flexible when it comes to coaching?

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,150
Well, I think that means that we have
to be really intentional about picking

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,870
effective practices to focus on that
are relevant to the virtual setting.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,069
So if a home visitor's working with a
parent and that child is at home alone,

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,700
I mean at home without other kids around,
it probably doesn't make sense to work on

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,860
teaching friendship skills, but it might.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,120
Be important to work on structuring
routines and helping children

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,710
learn about their daily routines.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,130
So we gotta really think about
effective practices that are relevant.

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,340
Um, I think we have to adjust our goals.

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,940
I think we have to make sure
that the goals that we're.

25
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,979
choosing are things that the
coach or the teacher or the

26
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,960
home visitor wants to work on.

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,120
And I think more than ever in the virtual
setting that we really need to think about

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,940
how are people gonna feel successful?

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,030
Because I think right now it's
hard to feel really successful.

30
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:51,320
And so we might wanna pick goals,
um, that are gonna help people.

31
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:54,375
, it feels successful more quickly.

32
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:58,485
And then the last thing I wanna just
mention is that I think we have to

33
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:05,625
be transparent in coaching virtually
about things that might be stressful

34
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:07,664
to teachers or home visitors.

35
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,835
So if we're gonna be videotaping,
that could be stressful, right?

36
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:15,345
So let's just be transparent
about why we're videotaping.

37
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,015
We're gonna video tape.

38
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,890
So that the coach or the home visitor
or the teacher can review the video

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,960
and we're not gonna be videotaping to
give that video to some supervisor.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,160
So I think if we're just transparent
about it, about what we're gonna

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,550
do with the video, that we can
help people feel more comfortable.

42
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,540
So, , how do coaches build, maintain,
and strengthen relationships

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,030
with coachee in a virtual space?

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,990
That seems like the kind of million
dollar question, I think, in a lot of

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,890
ways, and I think that there's lots
of strategies we can use that are

46
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:54,070
not really all that different than
what we would do in a live space.

47
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,130
Um, but I think some things
might become more important.

48
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,530
So I think we wanna be sure that in
our, that in our coaching sessions,

49
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,480
that we're building in time for casual
conversation that we're checking in

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,890
with the teacher or the home visitor,
whoever we're coaching about things

51
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,330
that we know are important to them.

52
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,970
So we might be checking in with
them about their new puppy dog, or

53
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,900
we might be checking in with them
about how their kids are doing, or.

54
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:26,945
, but we're saving some time in giving
some time to just checking in with them.

55
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:31,445
I think we wanna celebrate, we wanna
celebrate little wins because little

56
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,905
wins virtually might feel like big wins.

57
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:39,485
And that might be coaching
successes, it might be, um, personal

58
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,825
successes, but we wanna be sure we're
celebrating, um, those successes.

59
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,435
I think we wanna give coaches.

60
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,360
time to get used to the technology.

61
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,310
And so I think that the whole
technology thing may feel really

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,110
uncomfortable to some coaches.

63
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,810
Um, and I think we have to kind of
build in opportunities for people to

64
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,640
practice the technology without the
pressure of re reflection and feedback.

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,400
So we probably don't wanna
have the first time we.

66
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,285
Are gonna watch a video
be about coaching, right?

67
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:18,345
So maybe we just have a visit
where we say, we're gonna figure

68
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,785
out how to upload videos here.

69
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:23,655
I'm gonna upload a video of
myself and let's look at it.

70
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:27,855
And then what if, what if you
brought a video of your, your child

71
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,206
or something and let's upload it.

72
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:33,435
And let's just talk about the process
up of uploading and watching videos.

73
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:36,405
So what should coaches be observing?

74
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,469
when they're working with teachers
or home visitors who are supporting

75
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:41,940
virtual learning at home.

76
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:44,880
And what are some of the
strategies that they can use,

77
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,250
uh, during virtual observations?

78
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,770
I think we have to maybe reframe a little
bit what we think about observations

79
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,680
and what can count as an observ.

80
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:55,995
Observation.

81
00:04:56,325 --> 00:05:00,735
I think the first thing that we wanna
always remember is that whatever

82
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:04,725
we're doing related to observation
is based on the action plan.

83
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,845
And that, again, just
creates this safe space.

84
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:12,015
But I think we can think outside
the box of what it means to observe.

85
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:18,315
So it might mean we observe a teacher
doing a lesson with a group of kids.

86
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,260
Vir on their virtual platform.

87
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,890
Or it might mean that we observe
a home visitor doing a home visit

88
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,380
during, on the virtual platform.

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,990
But it might also mean that we're not
necessarily looking at the teacher, but

90
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,490
we're saying to the teacher, we're gonna,
we're gonna watch to see if children are

91
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:41,990
engaged and we're gonna kind of prompt
you for the kids who aren't engaged, cuz

92
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,050
it's too hard to be doing this virtual
learning and looking at a picture.

93
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,390
10 kids and figuring out
what kids are engaged.

94
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,020
So we can take a little bit of
pressure off by saying, we're gonna

95
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,349
look at the children, or we're gonna
look at the family, versus looking

96
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:57,170
at the teacher or the home visitor.

97
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:03,345
So what are some strategies coaches
can use for providing constructive

98
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:07,605
feedback to teachers and home visitors
during virtual coaching sessions?

99
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,985
One is that I would say we
should be really intentional

100
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:17,625
about grounding our feedback in
what we hear the coachee saying.

101
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:22,665
So we might think a session went
really well, and when we asked the

102
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:26,985
coachee, the home visitor, , they might
say, I thought that was a disaster.

103
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:33,015
So how do we ground our feedback
and our reflection in that, in the

104
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:37,905
perception of the coachee versus kind
of putting our own feelings on that?

105
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:45,015
I think one way to make help people
feel more comfortable is to focus our

106
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:51,645
feedback on the children or on the
families, meaning whoever the coachee.

107
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:55,185
So if the home visitors working with
the family or that teachers working with

108
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:59,925
kids that we're focusing on the family
and children and how they're responding

109
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:04,635
and how they're understanding what
goes on, that takes a little bit of.

110
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,765
Pressure off the the teacher or the home
visitor and it says, okay, so this child

111
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,955
looked like they weren't so engaged.

112
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:13,844
What could we do to support that child?

113
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,735
Feels a little less pressure.

114
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:20,385
I think we wanna avoid any kind of
feedback about technology cuz we're

115
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:23,575
all struggling with technology and we
just need to be helpful in that way.

116
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:32,804
Um, I really want people to be
sensitive to the limitations imposed

117
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:36,465
on teachers and home visitors and be
sure we're not giving them feedback

118
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,085
about things they can't control.

119
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:43,815
I think there's a couple of strategies
we can use that might not initially sound

120
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:46,575
like feedback, but served to be feedback.

121
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,800
I think share, asking teachers,
asking home visitors if you can share

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,910
their successes with other teachers
in-home visitors is a way of saying

123
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:58,560
what you're doing is really great.

124
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,570
And I think given this context
of all of us kind of learning as

125
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,700
we go, saying to you a coachee.

126
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:11,845
You know, I might wanna ask some of my
other coaches how they're handling that,

127
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:16,795
how their teachers are handling that, or
how their home visitors are handling that.

128
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:21,775
And that just again, says we're all
learning that we're all trying to

129
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:25,535
get better at doing this and that
none of us have all the answers.

130
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:31,835
what are some words of encouragement
that you want to share with coaches?

131
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:36,674
Um, with teaching staff and home
visitors and parents who are all

132
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,255
working together in this virtual space.

133
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:42,225
People have been doing research on
virtual coaching for a long time,

134
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,116
but people haven't been doing.

135
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:50,385
re research on virtual coaching to
coach people to teach virtually, right.

136
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:53,655
And so what that makes me think
is that we're just all learning.

137
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:56,685
We're all learning, we're
all gonna make mistakes.

138
00:08:57,074 --> 00:09:01,964
I think we have to assume good
intentions in the work that we're doing.

139
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:06,584
I think we have to assume that we're
all struggling, that we're all,

140
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:10,484
um, trying to do the best we can,
that we're all trying to juggle.

141
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:16,545
Kids and animals and jobs and houses and
partners and all of those kind of things.

142
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:20,355
And that we just have to assume
everybody's doing the best they

143
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:22,515
can under these situations.

144
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:27,704
And then I just wanna close by saying
that, you know, I think we're tempted.

145
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:34,135
To want to be fancy during this
time, to think about fancy ways to

146
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:40,225
have backgrounds behind us or having
a Bitmoji classroom or whatever.

147
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:43,444
But the people we're supporting
don't care about Fancy.

148
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,765
They want connections
and they want support.

149
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:50,785
And I think we know how
to make connections.

150
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:54,324
We know how to support
people and fancy is.

151
00:09:55,095 --> 00:10:00,135
But being connected, being
supportive, even in the absence

152
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:05,165
of fancy, of fancy backgrounds,
is gonna make us more successful.
